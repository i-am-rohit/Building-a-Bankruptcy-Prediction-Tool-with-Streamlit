<b>Title:</b> Building a Bankruptcy Prediction Tool with Streamlit

Description:<br>

Are you interested in evaluating the financial stability of businesses or making informed investment decisions? In this hands-on workshop, we'll guide you through the process of creating a bankruptcy prediction tool using Streamlit, a Python library for building interactive web applications.<br>

Agenda:<br>

Introduction to Bankruptcy Prediction: We'll begin by explaining the concept of bankruptcy prediction and why it's important for investors, creditors, and financial analysts.<br>

Data Collection and Preprocessing: Learn how to gather financial data from various sources and preprocess it for machine learning. We'll discuss the importance of feature engineering and data cleaning.<br>

Machine Learning Model Selection: Explore different machine learning algorithms for bankruptcy prediction, such as logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests. Discuss their pros and cons in the context of this application.<br>

Building the Streamlit App: Get hands-on experience with Streamlit to create an interactive web application. We'll cover how to design a user-friendly interface, display key financial ratios, and integrate your machine learning model.<br>

User Experience Enhancement: Learn how to incorporate visualizations and informative content to help users understand the prediction results and their significance.
<br>
Deployment and Sharing: Discover how to deploy your Streamlit app so that it's accessible to others. We'll discuss options like sharing it on platforms like Heroku or Streamlit Sharing.<br>

Q&A and Further Enhancements: Open the floor for questions and provide guidance on how to enhance the app further, such as adding more features, refining the model, or customizing the interface.<br>
